# TODO

## Upcoming Features

- Draw axes
- Change between log and linear axis scaling (per axis, not per plot)
- Allow multiple plots (either overlaid or side-by-side)
- Allow multiple plot types (line, scatter, box, etc.)
- Change plot styles (e.g. colours, line/point thickness, etc.)

## Other

- Constrain dependency versions to avoid issues later on.

- Might be useful to come up with a type of DSL for interacting with cplot;
  then the input stream could contain not only x,y-coordinates, but commands.
