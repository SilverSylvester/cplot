	Pretty much decided to use the `pipes' library for data streaming. As for graphics packages, so far we have:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item gloss
		\item dynamic-plot
		\item dynamic-graph
		\item Chart
		\item diagrams
		\item typed-spreadsheet
		\item plain OpenGL bindings
	\end{itemize}
	
	Going ahead with using gloss, mainly for ease of use (esp. since I have no prior background in any kind of graphics programming).
	
	\section*{2017-09-22}
	
	Decided to use Haskell's STM library to handle shared mutable state between gloss and the rest of the program. A gloss process is kicked-off with access to a TVar, which is modified by a pipe that continuously reads data from stdin (one line at a time). All it does, currently, is plot a stream of $ x,y $-coordinates onto a blank, white canvas.
	
	\section*{2017-09-24 --- 2017-09-25}
	
	On a new branch, \verb|anim->play| (which was, in hindsight, not a very good name for a branch), began the migration from the animateIO function to the playIO function to allow for custom event handling, which is no doubt needed. This lead to creating a barebones MVC-style backend, which should allow for much more complex features to be added in the future.
	
	\section*{2017-09-26}
	
	Merged \verb|anim->play| with \verb|master|. Work has begun on a new branch, \verb|axes|. This will deal primarily with drawing the axes, although it may end up involving writing a more robust view framework. Inside the viewport, you can have any number of `frames', which are distinct viewing areas, each having their own dataset, zoom level, styles, etc.
